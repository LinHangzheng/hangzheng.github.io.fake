    <p>I'm a junior student at <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute</a>.
    <p>I major in electronic and computer engineering and am interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially about deep learning. Recently, I am researching on an fast and accurate method to detect aggressive behavior and human falling by convolutional neural network.
    <p>I am currently working on bachelor degree of engineering and want to go to US for graduate school after graduation.

    <b>Content</b>: 2019 Mathematical Contest in Modeling problem B
        <li>The B problem asked teams to select, configure, optimally pack, geoposition, deploy and operate a set of midsize (group 2) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that would supplement existing relief medical supply chains on Puerto Rico. Once beyond identifying effective ‘DroneGo’ system configurations, teams were required to plan flight paths, schedules, and supply lift details throughout the island while conducting visual road reconnaissance and damage assessment to aid disaster relief operations. Implicit to this problem were two NP-hard problems involving 3D container packing optimization, thereby causing teams to adopt clever heuristics to address this aspect of the problem. </li>
        <li</li>
        <li>We proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant and our paper gets published on conference ICEBE 2019, and we are awarded as Best Paper of conference.</li>
